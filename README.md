## WELCOME TO THE GRAND THRALL-CHIVES
this is a website/program built for my lovely girlfriend/fiance/wife. 

she started doing art and 3d model comissions and i wanted to build an archive so she can refer back to clients when they come around again or have any issues with something.

thought it would be a good thing to have to keep some documentation on how client interactions and promises go so you can study what worked and what didn't and keep a log of those bad eggs that you really don't want to work for.

## basically i'm building an archival site
yeah the name is a play on the word but still would like to give you the headsup now instead of later.
